# Semantic Segmentation using U-Net

This repository contains an implementation of semantic segmentation using the U-Net architecture. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class, enabling detailed understanding of the image's contents.

## Overview

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category or class. U-Net is a popular architecture for this task due to its ability to capture fine-grained details while also preserving spatial information.
